  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "How does Verde Amor's technology differ from traditional composting?",
    "a1": "Our controlled dehydration technology is significantly faster (days vs. months), takes up less space, generates no odors, and produces multiple high-value products (biofertilizers, animal feed). Additionally, it allows complete traceability and carbon credit certification.",
    "q2": "What is the current development stage?",
    "a2": "Patented (PCT) and scientifically validated technology by UFRGS. We are in the fundraising phase to build our pilot unit and obtain environmental certifications. Project recognized at BRICS 2025 and selected by the EMERGE Brasil program.",
    "q3": "What are the investment opportunities?",
    "a3": "We are raising a Seed round for pilot unit construction, environmental certifications, and technical validations. We offer a diversified business model with 4 revenue streams and intellectual property protection in 158 countries.",
    "q4": "How do carbon credits work?",
    "a4": "Our technology avoids methane emissions through controlled processing of organic waste. Each ton processed generates approximately 0.7 tCO₂eq in certifiable reductions, which can be traded in the carbon market.",
    "q5": "Is the solution scalable?",
    "a5": "Yes, the model is modular and replicable. It can be implemented at different scales, from municipal units to industrial plants. The patented technology ensures operational consistency regardless of scale."
